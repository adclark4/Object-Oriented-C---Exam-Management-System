# Object-Oriented C++ Exam Management System

## üìå Overview
A C++ console application designed to simulate an exam management system using principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
This project demonstrates practical implementation of **inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and modular development**.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Created classes for **Exam**, **Overall**, and **Tester**, demonstrating robust **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.  
- Allowed multiple exam entries, score calculation, weighted averages, and customizable passing criteria.  
- Structured the project using ideal OOP organization, including `.h` and `.cpp` files, plus a Visual Studio C++ project for easy management.  
- Employed principles such as encapsulation and modular design to enhance maintainability.
